# Cryptography



### Index of Coincidence Attack

`Cindex.py` implements a method for calculating the Index of Coincidence of Cryptotext for the Vignere cipher of different key lengths
The purpose of this attack is to determine the most likely key length.



### Frequency Analysis

`FreqAnalysis.py` performs a frequency attack on the Shift and multiplicative cipher.
